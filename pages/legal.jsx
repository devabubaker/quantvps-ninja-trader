            destroyed immediately after the cancellation date. If the notice of
            cancellation is not provided within ten (10) days, the server will
            still be canceled however a termination fee of $25 will be applied
            to the account and must be paid within 15 days to avoid full account
            suspension.

            a report or otherwise becomes aware of abuse-related activities
            active on our network, we will identify the server the abuse was
            initially sent from (via IP and in some cases by domain) and create
            a ticket on behalf of the user who occupies the server with
            information regarding the abuse such as logs describing the abuse
            and an explanation of what abuse took place. The following actions
            will be taken on a case-by-case basis: – An abuse ticket serves as
            notification that our abuse department has received reports of abuse
            originating from the server. We require a client response to ALL
            abuse tickets within 24 hours of the ticket being opened. Typically,
            no service will be suspended or filtered within the first 24 hours
            of an abuse ticket being opened. If a response is not received
            within 24 hours, or the server is determined to be abusive (or
            likely to be abusive in the case of spam blacklistings) after the
            ticket is opened, our abuse technicians may filter or disable ports
            or IPs assigned to the server temporarily to prevent further abuse
            until a response is received.– If a response has not been received
            to an abuse ticket within 7 days of being opened, the server is
            eligible for suspension and may be completely disabled until we
            receive a response.– Habitual neglect of abuse occurring on a
            client’s server may lead to service termination or longer-term port
            filters as some blacklistings can take several weeks to time out or
            be removed.– QuantVPS reserves the right to refuse services to any
            client whose account(s) have been fined or terminated for
            abuse-related activities. If an IP range or IP address has been
            blacklisted as a result of excessive abuse reports, QuantVPS
            reserves the right to issue a fine of $200 and immediately terminate
            the service. Compromised servers issued abuse notifications: If our
            abuse department suspects that abuse reports associated with a
            client’s server are a result of the server’s security being
            compromised, our abuse department will offer the following options:
            – At the discretion of our abuse department, we will typically offer
            the ability to log in to the server and remedy the security
            compromise while leaving the abusive traffic filtered.– Offer an
            Operating System reinstallation, setting the configuration back to
            the original state it was provisioned in.– If Operating System
            reinstallation is not accepted as an option, QuantVPS may offer to
            manually retrieve/repair the files on the server, at a fee to be
            assessed and paid prior to any work being done. Habitual security
            compromises that result in abusive traffic being transmitted or
            received from the server may result in service termination. If a
            client wishes to dispute any abuse reports, or any fine assessed in
            connection with abuse reports or blacklistings, the client must
            provide QuantVPS with an explanation via QuantVPS ticketing system
            within 10 days of the abuse ticket being opened.

          </p>
          <p>
            QuantVPS handles any and all Digital Millennium Copyright Act
            (.DMCA.) complaints very seriously, and will thoroughly investigate
            each complaint received. QuantVPS reserves the right to pursue civil
            remedies for any costs associated with the investigation of a
            substantiated policy violation. The following actions will be taken
            on a case-by-case basis: – A ticket is opened as a warning,
            providing 24 hours to resolve the situation. – After 24 hours with
            no client response, connection to the IP address from the DMCA
            complaint will be disabled at the network level. At this time,
            QuantVPS reserves the right to assess a $25 fine. – After 72 hours
            with no resolution, services on the server in question will be
            suspended. – After 7 days of being suspended and the issue not
            having been resolved, services on the server in question will be
            canceled and an Abuse Charge of $200 will be placed on the account.
            All client data will be destroyed immediately after the cancellation
            date. – Users who violate this policy and fail to resolve the
            situation within 24 hours agree that in addition to these
            administrative penalties, they will pay .Research Fees’ not to
            exceed $50 per hour that QuantVPS personnel must spend to
            investigate the matter, to be charged only if claims are found to be

            <strong>2.13 Bandwidth Usage/Overages </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients agree to pay any and all bandwidth overage charges accrued
            on their account from the previous billing cycle. Bandwidth overage
            charges are billed per gigabyte at a rate of $0.25 (twenty-five
            cents) over the allotted bandwidth on the service. QuantVPS reserves
            the right to suspend any account which does not pay bandwidth
            overage charges within 15 days. QuantVPS is not responsible for
            spikes in bandwidth that are caused on a client’s service for any
            reason. Client assumes liability for all bandwidth to and from their
            services. If issued an expected to exceed bandwidth notification,
            clients are required to make payment arrangements within 24 hours of
            that notification to prevent possible service interruption until
            adequate arrangements are made. These arrangements may include being
            required to pro-actively upgrade bandwidth.

            <strong>2.14 Payment Verification </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients agree to submit to identity verification measures, designed
            for both the security of the client as well as the security of
            QuantVPS. The identity verification measures may include the faxing
            of two forms of government issued identification to QuantVPS, as
            well as a front and back copy of the credit card used for payment,
            as well as a copy of a utility bill with the billing address. In
            certain circumstances additional identity verification may be
            required, in addition to the previously listed forms.

            the right to use client quotes for promotional uses. Such quotes
            will be anonymous unless the client agrees to disclosure of their
            name. All communications from QuantVPS and the client are strictly
            confidential and for the intended use of the addressee only. Any
            disclosure, use or copying of the information by anyone other than

            <strong>2.19 Service Level Agreement </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective of this Service Level Agreement (hereafter referred to
            as “SLA”) is to define the guarantees made by{' '}
            <a href='http://QuantVPS.com'>QuantVPS.com</a> in regards to
            customer service, and availability of QuantVPS networks and hosting
            infrastructure. The SLA is included as an Exhibit to the Terms of
            Service, and is agreed to as a binding contract, by QuantVPS as well
            as the customer, upon acceptance of the Terms of Service. QuantVPS
            will use every method available to uphold the policies and practices
            defined in this SLA. Our customer support team is available 7 days a
            week to assist with all requests via live chat or email{' '}
            <a href='mailto:support@quantvps.com'>support@quantvps.com</a>. We
            aim to respond to queries within 1 to 5 hours of receipt (during
            weekdays), and to resolve each issue fully within 6 to 72 hours
            (depending on complexity of request).
          </p>
          <p>
            The backbone of <a href='http://QuantVPS.com'>QuantVPS.com</a>{' '}
            service is a commitment to service availability. To support this
            commitment, QuantVPS provides the following service level
            guarantees, and observes the following schedule of penalties when
            service level agreements are breached. QuantVPS guarantees that the
            services hosted on our networks will be available more than 99.99%
            of the time in a given calendar month. Availability is defined as
            the ability of an external system or user to communicate with
            services hosted on our networks via web, ICMP, RDP, or another
            protocol. A maintenance window opens Friday evenings at 10PM CT and
            closes 9PM CT. During these maintenance periods, services may
            experience brief interruptions as we maintain our network and
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each VPS system provided by QuantPS includes a “quota” for the usage
            of memory, processor, and other host system resources. QuantVPS
            guarantees that the quotas specified for each VPS plan will be made
            available to the customer, and will consider unavailability of said
            resources to contribute to the calculation of service
            unavailability. QuantVPS takes proactive measures to guarantee the
            redundancy of its hardware systems. Nonetheless, unavailability
            caused by hardware failures, host server crashes, and related
            spontaneous incidents will be compensated by the SLA.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.19a Network Availability </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Service unavailability resulting from network unavailability will be
            compensated by the SLA only if such network unavailability was
            caused by the negligence of QuantVPS, or by failure of systems
            directly administered by QuantVPS. As a provider of Internet
            services, QuantVPS relies on a number of bandwidth providers (ISPs)
            to provide connectivity to customer end-points. Outages on these
            providers’ networks, which may temporarily prevent customers from
            accessing services, or may even prevent outgoing connections from
            QuantVPS networks and systems, will not be compensated by the SLA.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.19b Scheduled Maintenance </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While QuantVPS systems are designed to accommodate hot-swappable
            components and live maintenance, situations may arise in the general
            course of systems maintenance that require temporary downtime of
            customer services. QuantVPS will do everything possible to schedule
            on weekends or other times with minimal trading activity, and will
            announce scheduled maintenance to all customers in advance.
            Scheduled maintenance is not included under the terms of the SLA.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.19c Downtime Credit Procedure </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers who record a significant amount of service unavailability
            (downtime) may report it to QuantVPS Customer Service and request a
            service credit as compensation. In the event of a breach of service
            availability, each 1 hour of unavailability will be compensated with
            a credit equal to 5% of the most recent payment made by the
            customer. Unavailability amounting to less than 1 hour will be
            pro-rated at the same rate. The maximum amount of service credit
            provided in a billing period will be 100% of the billing period’s
            subscription fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Requests for service unavailability credits should be submitted to
            the Billing department via support ticket or email, and must be
            submitted within 30 days of the reported outage to be eligible for
            credit. Upon receipt of downtime reports, QuantVPS will review
            information submitted by the customer, and provide a service credit
            if appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Service credits are provided in the form of account credits, which
            may be applied to any invoice generated by QuantVPS for a new or
            existing service, upgrade, or one-time fee. Service credits are not
            cash equivalents, cannot be withdrawn or deposited to a PayPal
            account, and cannot be transferred among customer accounts.

            <strong>2.19d Limitations </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While QuantVPS continuously monitors the status of its networks,
            and the physical hosts located there, it does not monitor the
            status of individual applications used by its customers. The
            guarantees provided by this SLA are meant to encompass large-scale
            outages caused by system failures and network unavailability, and
            do not apply to any particular software or services running inside
            the customers’s server, nor to a server’s Operating System.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guarantees made by this SLA do not apply in any situation where
            downtime is caused by, or could have been prevented by, the
            customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guarantees made by this SLA do not apply in circumstances where
            downtime has been caused by forces beyond the Company’s control,
            for example carrier outages and natural disasters.

            resources necessary to put their internet services online reliably
            in a lightning fast, high availability environment that responds
            quickly to each client’s individual needs.

          <p>
            All clients are allowed access to the public and private network;
            however misuse of the network in any way, including interference,
            will result in a violation of this AUP. All violations of this AUP
            shall be subject to review by QuantVPS, and an appropriate course of
            action shall be taken as determined by QuantVPS in its sole
            discretion. Proper use of public network must comply with all local,

            AUP or the Terms of Service is deemed in compliance and shall remain
            intact. If content is deemed to be in violation of this AUP or the
            Terms of Service, it shall be reviewed by QuantVPS, and a course of
            action shall be taken to correct the problem, which may result in
